# Named Entity Recognition

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is the task of locating named entity mentions in unstructured text and classifying them into pre-defined categories, such as person names, organizations, locations, etc.; but does not identify which specific entity it is.

Different Natural Language Processing libraries in Python to apply NER models to texts are considered, and also different online tools.
